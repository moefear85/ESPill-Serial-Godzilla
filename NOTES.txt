1- Only when Log Level is set to verbose, does any USB connect info become visible. Only connects are detectable.
Disconnects don't cause any activity. Not sure what the return value of any functions would be. The following is helpful:

V (645791) TUSB:DCD: dcd_int_handler - reset
V (645791) TUSB:DCD: dcd_int_handler - reset while suspend
V (645811) TUSB:DCD: dcd_int_handler - Speed enumeration done! Sending DCD_EVENT_BUS_RESET then
V (645991) TUSB:DCD: dcd_int_handler - rx!


From it, it is clear there is some dcd_int_handler involved. Modifying this can give me events. But even better, there seems to be official DCD_EVENT_BUS_RESET events sent out. Find out how to capture them, and see if any disconnect events available.
